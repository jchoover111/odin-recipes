  <!-- Descriptive paragraph #1 -->
  <p><strong>A Texas Thanksgiving</strong> isn't complete without a big pot of pinto beans. They make a hearty side dish to accompany a deep fried turkey, stuffing, and a faux-genteel dessert.</p>
  <p></p>

  <!-- Descriptive paragraph #2 -->
  <p>True Texas pintos are made by the pot with plenty of brisket and, for real flavor, the brisket burnt ends. Here's what you'll need and how to make 'em.</p>
  <p></p>

  <!-- Ingredients in an unordered list -->
  <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds pinto beans</li>
    <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chili powder</li>
    <li>3 T kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 T black pepper</li>
    <li>1 T onion powder</li>
    <li>2 T garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 t ground cumin</li>
    <li>2 pounds chopped brisket</li>
  </ul>



  <!-- Method as an ordered list -->
  <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the beans by rinsing and removing any rocks.</li>
    <li>Put the beans into a large crockpot and add the onion, chili powder, kosher salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and groun cumin. Add water until level is two inches above the beans, stir, and let soak overnight or for at least 8 hours.</li>
    <li>Keeping the beans and the soak water in the crockpot, add the chopped brisket. Also, add enough water to cover everything by two inches.</li>
    <li>Set the crockpot on low and a timer for ten hours.</li>
    <li>If the crockpot lid is too loose-fitting, you may lose water to steam as the beans cook. If the beans break the surface of the water, add a little <strong>boiling</strong> water so that they stay covered for the entire cooking time.</li>
    <li>Check the beans for doneness after six hours. They should retain their shape, but be unyielding to the bite. If they are not, give them a stir and check again 30 minutes. Leave the lid off of the crockpot at this point to allow excess water to evaporate.</li>
    <li>Stir and check every 30 minutes until beans are done.</li>
    <li>If the water level goes below the level of the beans, add a little <strong>boiling</strong> water to recover. Don't let the top dry out!</li>
  </ol>
