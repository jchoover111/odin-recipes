  <!-- Descriptive paragraph #1 -->
  <p><strong>Everyone knows</strong> that memories are strongest at the beginning and ending of family gettogethers. Even though everyone has stuffed themselves all day long, insist that they have a personal creme brulee before heading out the door.</p>
  <p></p>

  <!-- Descriptive paragraph #2 -->
  <p>Now, creme brulee doesn't exactly scream Texas like a big pot of beans or a smoked brisket. It's sophisticated. It's foreign. But if you let your guests caramelize their own tops, then everyone will get to play with fire! It's also no harder to make than brownies. So let's get started.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p>This recipe is totally lifted from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vib5idIADs">Creme Brulee Recipe</a> video on Home Cooking Adventure's YouTube channel. I have never found a better instructional for Creme Brulee than this.</p>

  <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
  <ul>

    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>

  </ul>



  <!-- Method as an ordered list -->
  <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 300F(150C).</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks with the sugar and vanilla until thick, creamy and pale yellow in color.</li>
    <li>Place the cream into a saucepan and heat until it just begins to boil at the edges. Pour a little at a time over the egg yolk mixture while whisking continuously.</li>
    <li>When all is combined, pour the mixture through a fine sieve into a pitcher so that it is easier to fill ramekins.</li>
    <li>Place 4 eight-ounce ramekins into a larger pan.</li>
    <li>Pour hot water into the larger pan until it comes up 2/3 to 3/4 of the height of the ramekins. Do not get any of the water into the ramekins.</li>
    <li>Pour the egg mixture into the ramekins in equal portions. The height of the egg mixture in the ramekins should be no higher that the water outside of them.</li>
    <li>Place the large pan into the oven on the center rack and bake for 30 to 35 mintes. The creme brulee is done when the edges seem set but the center still trembles when jiggled.</li>
    <li>Remove the ramekins from the hot water and let cool to room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
    <li>When ready to serve, cover the tops of the creme brulees with a tablespoon of granulated sugar and melt with a torch until a crispy caramel top is achieved. This is extremely hot, so let cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
