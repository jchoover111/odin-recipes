    <!-- Descriptive paragraph #1 -->
    <p><strong>Broccoli is broccoli.</strong> It's a plant and, as such, should generally be shunned around the holidays. No one wants to eat something green that doesn't taste like cookies or mints. That said, your mother-in-law is visiting, and she's going to judge you if you don't put something fibrous and flavorless into your mouth.</p>
    <p></p>

    <!-- Descriptive paragraph #2 -->
    <p>You will have to eat this to keep the peace. But don't worry. We'll do it up right so that it mostly tastes like butter and salt.</p>
    <p></p>

    <!-- Ingredients in an unordered list -->
