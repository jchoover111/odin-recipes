    <h1>Regular Ol' Broccoli</h1>

    <p><strong>    Broccoli is broccoli.</strong> It's a plant and, as such, should generally be shunned around the holidays. No one wants to eat something green that doesn't taste like cookies or mints. That said, your mother-in-law is visiting, and she's going to harangue you until you put something fibrous and flavorless into your mouth.</p>

    <p>    You will have to eat this to keep the peace. But don't worry. We'll do it up right so that it mostly tastes like butter and salt.</p>
