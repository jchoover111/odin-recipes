  <p><strong>    It's gonna be</strong> a big day. Start right with a healthy plate of scrambled eggs. They'll give you plenty of butter, for sexy vitality, and protein, to keep you full and strong in the face of those snacking temptations while you prepare the day's real menu.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>    Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so let's get to it.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 eggs</li>
    <li>1/4 t salt</li>
    <li>4 T butter</li>
    <li>Salt, pepper, or other seasonings to taste</li>
  </ul>  

  <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the butter in a 12" skillet on the stove on medium-low heat.</li>
      <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and add the salt.</li>
      <li>Using a whisk or fork, beat the eggs for about a minute. The key is to have 
        no strands of white remaining in the egg mixture.</li>
      <li>Once the butter is melted, transfer the eggs to the skillet.</li>
      <li>Stir the eggs constantly as they cook, moving the cooked egg curds
        away from the center of the pan. Uncooked egg should run into the middle
        of the pan initially. As the eggs cook and the uncooked eggs are no longer
        runny enough to flow to the center of the pan, you will need to stir them over.
      </li>
      <li>Keep stirring the entirety of the egg mass with a goal of moving the wettest
        parts to the center of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>When the eggs appear to be mostly cooked, but before they look dry, transfer 
        then to a plate. Residual heat in the eggs will continue to cook them, but they 
        should be served somewhat moist.
      </li>
      <li>Top with additional salt to taste, and pepper or other seasoning.</li>
    </ol>
