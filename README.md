Preliminary README.md.

This is a basic HTML project to fulfil the Recipes
project requirement for HTML Foundations at
The Odin Project.

This project is principally done. Were it a real 
project I would resize the pictures, attribute the 
authors appropriately, and do something more inspiring
with the homepage. However, since the learning 
objectives have been met and the material for doing
most refining has not been covered in the curriculum
yet, I will stop here.
